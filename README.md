# FinalProject# Automatic Cat Feeder

## Introduction

- **What it does:** This project is an automatic device for feeding a cat. It allows programming three meals per day and offers the option to manually distribute an additional portion of food.
- **Purpose:** To automate cat feeding, ensuring regular and controlled meals.
- **Idea behind it:** The need to feed cats at fixed times, even in the owner's absence.
- **Why itâ€™s useful:** It helps maintain the cat's health and provides convenience for the owner.
