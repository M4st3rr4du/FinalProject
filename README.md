FinalProject
Simple Games on ATmega328P
Introduction
What it does: This project implements a set of simple games (e.g., Snake, Blocks) on an ATmega328P microcontroller, using an LED matrix and an LCD screen for display.
Purpose: To provide an interactive and educational platform for demonstrating basic game development on embedded systems.
Idea behind it: Combining creativity and technology to build retro-style games on a low-power microcontroller.
Why itâ€™s useful: It showcases fundamental principles of game logic and embedded programming in a fun and engaging way.

Implemented Games and Features
Snake:
The player controls a growing snake to collect food, avoiding walls and itself.
Blocks:
A Tetris-inspired game where the player arranges falling blocks to clear lines.
Functions Implemented
Game selection menu
Real-time game updates and rendering
Input handling for navigation and gameplay
Score tracking and display
Results
The system successfully runs both games:
